I developed an interest in technology in my early days of high school when I built my first 'website', if you could call it that. From there developed a passion for software and recently recived my degree in Computer Engineering from San Francisco State University. Since then I have had the privilege of working with amazing people at Apple's CI Tech team and I am currently pursuing a career in Software Engineering.",
