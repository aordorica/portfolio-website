    "about": "I am a SF Bay Area native and recent Computer Engineering grad from San Francisco State University, where I learned Java, Javascript, Swift, React and Python. I enjoy backend work working with data but I am also conformable working on robust, dynamic frontend systems., I worked as Genius technician where I became iOS and MacOS certified. I recently completed an internship with Apple's CI automation team where I focused on automating, maintaining, and expanding UI and system testing for iOS and macOS fleet devices using Ansible configuration tools. I am eager to bring a new set of technical skills to my new career as a software engineer."
